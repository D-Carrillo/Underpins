🔐 Underthread

A modular, theme-driven desktop workspace for brainstorming, planning, and connecting ideas.

Underthread is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript. It reimagines sticky notes and boards as a creative, immersive environment where users can:

📝 Create and arrange notes freely on custom boards.

🔗 Draw connections between notes to map out ideas visually.

🎶 Enable ambient music & focus timers for a tailored work vibe.

🎨 Switch between immersive themes — from a minimal whiteboard to an alternative, retro detective mode.

🔒 Lock boards with passwords for private or sensitive projects.

🖼️ Import custom images and audio to personalize the workspace.

The app is designed to be modular and extensible, so future contributors (or power users) can add their own themes, widgets, or integrations.
